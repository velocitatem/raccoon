# Prompt Injections Bounty Hunt
Submit a list of possible prompt injections in the following format:

## How?
Put together a CSV of the following format:

## Why?
This is a bounty hunt to find prompt injections in the wild. The goal is to find as many as possible and then use them to test for prompt injections, to make AI safer.

## Reward
For every prompt injection you find, you will receive 1 bounty point. You can then redeem these points:
+ 1 point = 5 USD

Only the first 20 prompts will be accepted, unless more funding is raised.

## How to submit
Submit a pull request to this repository with the CSV file. The file should be named `prompt-injections.csv` and should be in the root directory of the repository. The file should be in the format described above. If you have any questions, please open an issue.
